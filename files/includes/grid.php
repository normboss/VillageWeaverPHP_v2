                            The studio is located in a beautiful 1790's Federal home,
                            on the coastal Pemaquid pennisula. The weaving
                            studio and shop is cozy in the winter and cool in
                            the summer. I enjoy meeting customers as they drop
                            in during the day.

                            In the late 1970’s, I was a young mother living on an
                            island north of Seattle, Washington. My husband, Andy,
                            was in Alaska fishing for months at a time. Long stretches
                            of time and solitude allowed me to focus on my weaving.

                        <div>
                            After moving back east, Andy began his career as a full time
                            blacksmith. We traveled together to craft shows, featuring
                            early Americana. My work centered on textiles, with Early
                            American inspired patterns. It was a rich time in our lives,
                            meeting other craftspeople and exchanging wares and
                            stories. We were featured in the magazines
                            "Colonial Homes","Country Living" and "Country Home".

                            for a very long time. It's too special to ever step on it!
